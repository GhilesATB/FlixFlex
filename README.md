## SOLID principles:

the SOLID principles of object-oriented programming. For the fundamental state of matter, see Solid. For other uses, see Solid (disambiguation).
SOLID
Principles
Single responsibility
Open–closed
Liskov substitution
Interface segregation
Dependency inversion

In software engineering, SOLID is a mnemonic acronym for five design principles intended to make object-oriented designs more understandable, flexible, and maintainable.

The SOLID ideas are

The Single-responsibility principle: "There should never be more than one reason for a class to change."
In other words, every class should have only one responsibility.
The Open–closed principle: "Software entities ... should be open for extension, but closed for modification."
The Liskov substitution principle: "Functions that use pointers or references to base classes must be able to use objects of derived classes without knowing it." See also design by contract.
The Interface segregation principle: "Clients should not be forced to depend upon interfaces that they do not use."
The Dependency inversion principle: "Depend upon abstractions, concretions."
The SOLID acronym was introduced later, around 2004, by Michael Feathers.

Although the SOLID principles apply to any object-oriented design, they can also form a core philosophy for methodologies such as agile development or adaptive software development.

## Layered Architecture

Definition

- The layered architecture style is one ofthe most common architectural styles. The idea behind
  Layered Architecture is that modules or components with similarfunctionalities are
  organized into horizontal layers. As a result, each layer performs a specific role within the
  application.

- The layered architecture style does not have a restriction on the number of layers that the
  application can have, as the purpose is to have layers that promote the concept ofseparation of
  concerns. The layered architecture style abstracts the view ofthe system as a whole while
  providing enough detail to understand the roles and responsibilities ofindividual layers and
  the relationship between them.
